Dijkstra's Algorithm with Priority Queues

Compiling/Running the Program

- In total there are 3 .java files
- I also provided the 2 data input files and sample Output file in the .zip folder


Compiling
- The Main class is in ProjectSix.java
- do "java ProjectSix.java" to compile the program

Running
- do "java ProjectSix" to run the program
- this will create a output file which contains the dikjstra's shortest path using the priority queues

- NOTE: Change the name of the input files since it doesn't work from the command lines
